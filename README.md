## Developer guidelines
Always take note of the following notes.
1. **NEVER directly push nor edit main.** Before coding, always create a branch from the main branch.
2. **Add comments if applicable.** A comment is recommended if you are not able to understand what a code block does with just a few seconds of reading.
3. **NEVER merge pull requests automatically.** 
4. **Always develop MOBILE-FIRST.** Mobile-to-desktop adjustment is easier compared to the other way around.
